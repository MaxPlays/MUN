# MUN
A MUN session management software
## Description ##
This web-based project is meant to be used as a management tool for MUN sessions.
## Configuration and prerequisites ##
### Dependencies ###
This tool depends on:
- A working and PHP-ready web server (preferably Apache)
- PHP 5 and upwards
- A working MySQL server
### Configuration ###
This software is very easy to configure. First, make sure that the above-mentioned dependencies are fulfilled. Now, enter your MySQL credentials in the config.php file, open your browser and navigate to cfg/config.html. Here you can see a table containing all registered committees along with both of their topics. You can remove a row by clicking on the corresponding "X" symbol at it's end. To create a new committee, expand the "Create" section by clicking on the provided text. Enter the committee's name (has to be unique) and the two topics and select all participating countries. When you are done, click on "Create committee" and wait for a new row to appear in the table above. The new committee should now show up on the main menu of the index.html file.
